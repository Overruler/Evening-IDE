This directory is to allow customizing a build locally by including 
additional binary plugins without them showing as changes in git.

Add any additional files and directory trees to this source folder, 
arranged exatcly in the structure they should appear in the final 
build result.

Typically there would be a plugins-directory containing binary 
plugins that you have downloaded earlier from an update site 
for offline installation.

This file and any directories starting with a dot are not included 
in the final build. For example, you could have a directories like:
 
/.downloaded/some-update-site-1.2.3.zip
/.unzipped/some-update-site-1.2.3/some-plugin-1.2.3.jar
/.unzipped/some-update-site-1.2.3/some-dependency-1.1.1.jar

for organizing files and then the directories for including them 
in the build like:

/plugins/some-plugin-1.2.3.jar
/plugins/some-dependency-1.1.1.jar
/features/some-feature/feature.xml 
etc..
