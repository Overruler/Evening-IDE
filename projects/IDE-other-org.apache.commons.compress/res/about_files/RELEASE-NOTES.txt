              Apache Commons Compress 1.6 RELEASE NOTES

The Commons Compress team is pleased to announce the
commons-compress-1.6 release!

Apache Commons Compress software defines an API for working with
compression and archive formats.  These include: bzip2, gzip, pack200,
xz and ar, cpio, jar, tar, zip, dump, 7z, arj.

Version 1.6 introduces changes to the internal API of the tar package that 
break backwards compatibility in the following rare cases.  This version 
removes the package private TarBuffer class along with the protected "buffer" 
members in TarArchiveInputStream and TarArchiveOutputStream.  This change will 
only affect you if you have created a subclass of one of the stream classes 
and accessed the buffer member or directly used the TarBuffer class.

Changes in this version include:

New features:
o Added support for 7z archives.  Most compression algorithms
  can be read and written, LZMA and encryption are only
  supported when reading.  Issue: COMPRESS-54. Thanks to Damjan Jovanovic. 
o Added read-only support for ARJ archives that don't use
  compression.  Issue: COMPRESS-226. Thanks to Damjan Jovanovic. 
o DumpArchiveInputStream now supports an encoding parameter that
  can be used to specify the encoding of file names. 
o The CPIO streams now support an encoding parameter that can be
  used to specify the encoding of file names. 
o Read-only support for LZMA standalone compression has been added.
  Issue: COMPRESS-111.

Fixed Bugs:
o TarBuffer.tryToConsumeSecondEOFRecord could throw a
  NullPointerException  Issue: COMPRESS-223. Thanks to Jeremy Gustie. 
o Parsing of zip64 extra fields has become more lenient in order
  to be able to read archives created by DotNetZip and maybe
  other archivers as well.  Issue: COMPRESS-228. 
o TAR will now properly read the names of symbolic links with
  long names that use the GNU variant to specify the long file
  name.  Issue: COMPRESS-229. Thanks to Christoph Gysin. 
o ZipFile#getInputStream could return null if the archive
  contained duplicate entries.
  The class now also provides two new methods to obtain all
  entries of a given name rather than just the first one.
  Issue: COMPRESS-227. 
o CpioArchiveInputStream failed to read archives created by
  Redline RPM.  Issue: COMPRESS-236. Thanks to Andrew Duffy. 
o TarArchiveOutputStream now properly handles link names that
  are too long to fit into a traditional TAR header.  Issue:
  COMPRESS-237. Thanks to Emmanuel Bourg.
o The auto-detecting create*InputStream methods of Archive and
  CompressorStreamFactory could fail to detect the format of
  blocking input streams.  Issue: COMPRESS-239. 

Changes:
o Readabilty patch to TarArchiveInputStream.  Issue:
  COMPRESS-232. Thanks to BELUGA BEHR.
o Performance improvements to TarArchiveInputStream, in
  particular to the skip method.  Issue: COMPRESS-234. Thanks to BELUGA BEHR.
