{"name":"Evening-ide","tagline":"Incremental build of Eclipse from within Eclipse.","body":"# Evening-IDE\r\nThis is an Eclipse build that's meant to be built inside Eclipse itself. And not only that, the build is an *incremental* build!\r\n\r\n## What's New\r\nIn addition to a build process optimized for speed and convenience, there are also other changes, mainly for Java developers.\r\n\r\n### More Usable Refactoring\r\nExtracting and Inlining local variables is possible from almost anywhere from a line and does what's expected.\r\n![Animation showing freely extracting and inlining local variables](https://raw.github.com/Overruler/eclipse.jdt.core/master/refactoring_2.gif)\r\n\r\n### A Smarter Content Assist\r\nSuggestions list shows all implementation classes of an interface.\r\n![Screenshot showing all List subclasses suggested in Content Assist](https://raw.github.com/Overruler/eclipse.jdt.core/master/subclasses_new.png)\r\n\r\nMethods from the subclass are listed before methods from superclass(es).\r\n![Screenshot showing methods from JFrame suggested before super-class methods](https://raw.github.com/Overruler/eclipse.jdt.core/master/methods_new.png)\r\n\r\n# How to Get It, EGit way\r\n1. Clone this repository in EGit and download all submodules.\r\n2. After that is finished, use Import... Existing projects from Eclipse.\r\n  * Don't import from EGit, as this doesn't track the projects correctly and can cause very long pauses during builds.\r\n3. Import all the projects under `<repository root>/projects` without copying them into your workspace.\r\n\r\nThe first build will take a longer time. When it is done, the compiled IDE can be found in `<repository root>/projects/IDE/target/ide-1` or `<repository root>/projects/IDE/target/ide-2`.\r\n\r\nThe built IDE includes SWT and other x64 native parts for Windows, MacOS and Linux. If the MacOS and Linux versions work, *let me know!*\r\n\r\nSee also the `<repository root>/projects/IDE-all-extras/extras` folder for adding your favorite plugins, features or anything else to the final IDE.\r\n\r\n## License\r\nEvening-IDE is licensed under the [Eclipse Public License (EPL) v1.0](http://wiki.eclipse.org/EPL)\r\n\r\nSome other (similar) licenses may also apply. See the source code for each submodule for details.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
